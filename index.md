## About Me

Hi! I am Sheng Li. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by Dr. Xulong Tang. I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Sichuan University, China, in 2020. 
My research focuses on designing and optimizing efficient machine learning algorithms and systems, targeting both resource-constrained edge devices and powerful cloud servers.
