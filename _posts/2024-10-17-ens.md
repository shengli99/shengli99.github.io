Trellix and Qualys are two cybersecurity services for "Endpoint Detection and Response" or EDR. If installed on a computer by an employer or other entity, these programs open a backdoor that gives the employer, etc., total or 'root' access to the machine at the Operating System level. This includes the ability to access all files on the computer, open a remote desktop for live viewing, or delete all data on the computer.

As deployed in most corporate environments, these services are not programmed to hide themselves from the user. Here is how you can detect if Trellix or Qualys is installed on your computer:

# Mac OS

1. Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type `Activity` in the search field, then click Activity Monitor:

3. In the search bar on the top right-hand corner, type `qualys` . If Qualys is installed, you should just see this. If it is not installed, it should be blank.
