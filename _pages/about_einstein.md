Hi! I am Sheng Li. I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), advised by [Dr. Xulong Tang](https://xzt102.github.io/). I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/), China, in 2020. 
My research focuses on designing and optimizing efficient machine learning algorithms and systems, targeting both resource-constrained edge devices and powerful cloud servers.

:sparkles: I am currently seeking internship opportunities as a research scientist, applied scientist, machine learning engineer, or software development engineer. Please feel free to contact me with any potential roles.
